## 🚀 Overview

This repository acts as a **Biomedical Operating System (BioOS)**, orchestrating a comprehensive library of **skills, agents, and mathematical foundations** for modern (2026) Artificial Intelligence. 

Unlike standard codebases, this project transforms static scripts into **Agentic Workflows**—where autonomous systems plan, execute, use tools, and correct themselves to solve complex scientific problems. It is designed to support high-impact research, clinical decision support, and automated lab operations.

## 👤 Author & Maintainer

## 📜 Standardized Skill Format

All skills now adhere to the **SKILL.md** standard, making them discoverable and executable by the BioKernel. Each skill definition includes:
*   **Description:** Concise summary of capabilities.
*   **Keywords:** Core terms for indexing.
*   **Measurable Outcome:** SMART goals (e.g., "Rank 5 trials in <3 mins").
*   **Allowed Tools:** Security sandboxing for agent execution.

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

**1. Match a Patient to a Clinical Trial (TrialGPT):**
```bash
python3 Skills/Clinical/Trial_Matching/TrialGPT/run_matching.py --patient_profile ./patient.json
```

**2. Design an Antibody (MAGE):**
```bash
python3 Skills/Drug_Discovery/Antibody_Design/MAGE/generate.py --antigen "spike_protein" --count 5
```

**3. Analyze Spatial Transcriptomics (STAgent):**
```bash
python3 Skills/Genomics/Spatial_Transcriptomics/STAgent/main.py --data ./visium_data.h5ad --task "cluster_domains"
```
