USER'S INPUT

Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES! Remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else - even if you just want to respond to the user. Do NOT respond with anything except a JSON snippet no matter what!"""  # noqa: E501
