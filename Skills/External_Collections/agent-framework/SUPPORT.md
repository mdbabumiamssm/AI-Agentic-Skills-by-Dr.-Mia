## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing

feature request as a new Issue.

For help and questions about using this project, please create a GitHub issue.

AI Support team will support Microsoft Agent Framework issues for customers under a **Unified support agreement when the issue arises from usage of Azure AI services** (Foundry Models, Foundry Agents etc.) in conjunction with the SDK. Conversely, if customer has any other / non unified support agreement and/or Agent Framework SDK is used in a way **not involving an Azure service**, it is treated as a purely open-source tool – Microsoft’s support organization will not handle it, and users should use GitHub or forums for assistance

For Copilot Studio SDK implementation issues, customers should use GitHub Issues for assistance, as outlined above. Conversely, for prerequisites managed within the Copilot Studio portal, customers can rely on the standard Microsoft Copilot Studio support channels.

## Microsoft Support Policy  

Support for this **PROJECT or PRODUCT** is limited to the resources listed above.
