## **Steps to Delete an Agent**
1. **Locate the Agent**
    * Navigate to the Monitor Tab in the AutoGPT builder
    * Find the agent you want to delete from the list
2. **Select the Agent**
    * Click on the agent you wish to delete
3. **Delete the Agent**
    * Look for the trash icon on the right side of the interface
    * Click the trash icon
    * A confirmation dialog will appear asking "Are you sure you want to delete this agent?"
    * Click "Yes, delete" to confirm

Once confirmed, the agent will be immediately removed from your list.

**Note**: This action cannot be undone, so make sure you want to permanently delete the agent before confirming.
