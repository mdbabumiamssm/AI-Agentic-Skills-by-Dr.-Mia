# Semantic Kernel Migration Playground

This is a playground folder with different **Semantic Kernel** projects that can be used to test automatic AI migration to the new **Agent Framework (AF)**.

## Prompting

Open your IDE Agentic extension and create a new chat providing the following prompt:

```
I need to convert code from Semantic Kernel to the Agent Framework. 
Please use the migration guide provided in the #SemanticKernelToAgentFramework.md as a reference.

The current solution is using central package manager, when referencing the projects in the csproj don't provide the versions.

Check external references provided by the migration guide if needed.

You don't need to look for the Central Package Management file, just focus on the project file and the code files.

When you need help or don't know how to proceed, please ask.
```
