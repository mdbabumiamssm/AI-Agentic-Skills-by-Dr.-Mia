## Azure AI Agents

For details on using Azure AI Agents within Semantic Kernel, see the [README](../../../getting_started_with_agents/azure_ai_agent/README.md) in the `getting_started_with_agents/azure_ai_agent` directory.

### Running the `azure_ai_agent_ai_search.py` Sample

Before running this sample, ensure you have a valid index configured in your Azure AI Search resource. This sample queries hotel data using the sample Azure AI Search hotels index.

For configuration details, refer to the comments in the sample script. For additional guidance, consult the [README](../../memory/azure_ai_search_hotel_samples/README.md), which provides step-by-step instructions for creating the sample index and generating vectors. This is one approach to setting up the index; you can also follow other tutorials, such as those on "Import and Vectorize Data" in your Azure AI Search resource.

### Requests and Rate Limits

For information on configuring rate limits or adjusting polling, refer [here](../../../getting_started_with_agents/azure_ai_agent/README.md#requests-and-rate-limits)
