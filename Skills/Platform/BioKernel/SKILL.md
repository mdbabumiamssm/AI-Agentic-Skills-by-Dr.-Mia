# CoreKernel

The CoreKernel is the central orchestration layer of the AI Agentic Platform, managing context, routing tasks to specialized agents via MCP (Model Context Protocol), and handling system resources.

## When to Use This Skill

*   **System Internal**: This is primarily a background skill for routing.
*   When initializing the AI Agentic Platform environment.
*   When managing state across multiple agent interactions.

## Core Capabilities

1.  **Task Routing**: Dispatches user queries to the correct specialist agent.
2.  **Context Management**: Maintains long-term memory and session state.
3.  **MCP Server**: Exposes tools and resources via standard protocol.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Start the CoreKernel server."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 platform/core_kernel/server.py --port 8000
```
