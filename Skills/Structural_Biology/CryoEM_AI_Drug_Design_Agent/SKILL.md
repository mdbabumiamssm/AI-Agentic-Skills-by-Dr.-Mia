# Cryo-EM AI Drug Design Agent

The **Cryo-EM AI Drug Design Agent** integrates cryo-electron microscopy structural data with AlphaFold3, generative AI, and molecular dynamics for structure-based drug design. It enables targeting of previously "undruggable" proteins including flexible, membrane-bound, and large macromolecular complexes through high-resolution structure-guided optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

* When designing drugs against cryo-EM-solved targets.
* For fragment-based drug discovery with EM structures.
* To model ligand binding in flexible protein regions.
* When targeting membrane proteins and large complexes.
* For integrating AlphaFold predictions with experimental EM density.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Density-Guided Design**: Fit ligands into cryo-EM density maps.

2. **AlphaFold Integration**: Combine AF3 predictions with EM data.

3. **Flexible Docking**: Account for protein dynamics in binding.

4. **Fragment Screening**: Virtual fragment screening with EM structures.

5. **Complex Targeting**: Design for multi-protein assemblies.

6. **Dynamics-Based Design**: Incorporate conformational flexibility.

## Cryo-EM for Drug Discovery

| Target Class | Cryo-EM Advantage | Drug Discovery Application |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| GPCRs | Native lipid environment | Allosteric sites |
| Ion Channels | Multiple conformations | State-specific design |
| Transporters | Conformational states | Mechanism-based |
| Ribosomes | Antibiotic binding | New antibiotics |
| Viral Proteins | Large assemblies | Vaccines, antivirals |
| Intrinsically Disordered | Flexible regions | Challenging targets |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Cryo-EM density map, protein sequence, ligand/fragment.

2. **Structure Refinement**: AlphaFold + density-guided refinement.

3. **Binding Site Identification**: Detect pockets in EM structure.

4. **Ligand Placement**: Density-guided ligand fitting.

5. **MD Simulation**: Flexible binding simulation.

6. **Optimization**: Generative design around hits.

7. **Output**: Optimized ligands, binding models, design recommendations.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Design ligands for this GPCR cryo-EM structure, accounting for receptor flexibility in the binding pocket."

**Agent Action**:
