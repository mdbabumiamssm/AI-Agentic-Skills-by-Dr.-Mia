# Time-Resolved Cryo-EM Agent

The **Time-Resolved Cryo-EM Agent** leverages time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy to capture protein dynamics, drug-binding kinetics, and conformational transitions. It integrates AI-powered analysis with experimental time-resolved data to enable dynamics-based drug discovery, moving beyond static structures to understand drug mechanisms in motion.

## When to Use This Skill

* When studying drug-binding kinetics structurally.
* For capturing protein conformational transitions.
* To understand allosteric mechanisms and dynamics.
* When designing drugs targeting specific conformational states.
* For characterizing enzyme catalytic cycles.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Kinetics Extraction**: Extract binding kinetics from time-resolved data.

2. **Conformational Sorting**: Classify particles by conformational state.

3. **Trajectory Reconstruction**: Build conformational trajectories.

4. **Intermediate Identification**: Detect rare intermediate states.

5. **MD Integration**: Combine with molecular dynamics simulations.

6. **Dynamics-Based Design**: Design drugs targeting specific states.
