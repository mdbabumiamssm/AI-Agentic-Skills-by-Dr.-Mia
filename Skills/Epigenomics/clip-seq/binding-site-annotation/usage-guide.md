# Binding Site Annotation - Usage Guide

## Overview

Annotate CLIP-seq peaks to genomic features like UTRs, CDS, and introns.

## Prerequisites

```r
BiocManager::install(c('ChIPseeker', 'TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene'))
```

## Quick Start

- "Annotate peaks to transcript features"
- "What fraction of peaks are in 3'UTRs?"

## Example Prompts

> "Annotate my CLIP peaks with ChIPseeker"

> "Show distribution across UTRs, CDS, introns"

## What the Agent Will Do

1. Load peaks and annotation
2. Assign peaks to features
3. Create summary pie chart

## Tips

- **3'UTR enrichment** common for mRNA stability regulators
- **Intron enrichment** common for splicing factors
