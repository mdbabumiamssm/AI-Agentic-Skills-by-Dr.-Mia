# Multimodal Medical Imaging Analysis

The **Multimodal Medical Imaging Analysis Skill** leverages state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o to interpret medical imagery alongside clinical text.

## When to Use This Skill

*   When you need a preliminary screening of medical images.
*   When correlating visual findings with textual clinical notes.
*   To generate structured reports (DICOM-SR-like) from raw images.

## Core Capabilities

1.  **Anomaly Detection**: Identify potential pathologies in X-rays, CTs, etc.
2.  **Report Generation**: Draft radiology reports in standard formats.
3.  **VQA (Visual Question Answering)**: Answer specific questions about an image (e.g., "Is there a fracture in the left femur?").

## Workflow

1.  **Input**: Provide an image file path (JPG, PNG) and a specific clinical question or "generate report" instruction.
2.  **Analyze**: The agent sends the image and prompt to the VLM.
3.  **Output**: Returns a JSON object with findings, confidence scores, and reasoning.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze this chest X-ray for pneumonia."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Clinical/Medical_Imaging/Multimodal_Analysis/multimodal_agent.py \
    --image "/path/to/cxr.jpg" \
    --prompt "Check for signs of pneumonia and consolidation."
```
