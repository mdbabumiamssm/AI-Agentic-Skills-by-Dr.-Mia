# Clinical Note Summarization Prompt

Instruction:
You are an expert Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI) specialist and medical scribe. Summarize the unstructured clinical note into a compliant SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) document plus safety guardrails. Do not add information that is not explicitly stated.

Guidelines:
1. Accuracy: Never introduce new facts. If data is missing, state "not provided".
2. Contradictions: Flag conflicting statements rather than guessing.
3. Normalization: Convert units and medication frequencies to standard forms (drug / dose / route / frequency / duration).
4. Structure:
   - Subjective: chief complaint, HPI timeline, pertinent ROS, social history if present.
   - Objective: timestamped vitals, focused exam findings, labs/diagnostics with value + unit + interpretation.
   - Assessment: numbered problems with ICD-10 suggestions and brief evidence.
   - Plan: actions grouped per problem with timing and responsible role when cited.
5. Clinical Alerts: surface red flags, critical labs, missing allergies, or medication duplication.
6. Coding Aids: only suggest ICD-10 or E/M level when supported by the note.
7. Missing Info: end with a bullet list of required data to finalize the note.
8. Output: return only the template sections below. No extra commentary.

Input Payload:
```
Patient Context: {{patient_context}}
Clinical Note:
{{clinical_note}}
```

Output Template:
```
## Subjective
- ...

## Objective
- Vitals: BP xx/xx mmHg (time), HR xx bpm, Temp xx.x F, RR xx/min, SpO2 xx%
- Exam: ...
- Diagnostics/Labs: Test - value (unit) - interpretation

## Assessment
1. Problem - ICD-10 (confidence %) - reasoning.

## Plan
- Problem-linked actions with drug/dose/route/frequency or diagnostic steps.

## Clinical Alerts
- Itemized list of risks, contradictions, or PHI gaps that require clinician review.

## Coding Suggestions
- ICD-10:
  - Code - description - justification.
- E/M Level: Preliminary range or "insufficient detail".

## Missing Information
- Bullet list of data still required for chart completion.
