# Virtual Lab Agent

The **Virtual Lab Agent** orchestrates AI-powered virtual scientific research teams consisting of specialized agents (Principal Investigator, Immunologist, Computational Biologist, Machine Learning Specialist) to autonomously conduct biomedical research. Inspired by Stanford's AI Scientist model, it enables hypothesis generation, experimental design, in silico validation, and research synthesis.

## When to Use This Skill

* When exploring new research hypotheses autonomously.
* For designing experiments with AI-generated protocols.
* To synthesize literature and generate research directions.
* When validating hypotheses through computational experiments.
* For multi-disciplinary research requiring diverse expertise.
