# Digital Twin Clinical Agent

The **Digital Twin Clinical Agent** creates AI-powered virtual replicas of individual patients by integrating genomics, imaging, wearable data, and clinical records. These digital twins enable clinical trial simulation, treatment response prediction, and personalized therapeutic optimization, qualified by EMA and aligned with FDA guidance.

## When to Use This Skill

* When simulating clinical trial outcomes for drug development.
* For creating patient-specific treatment response predictions.
* To optimize clinical trial design and reduce sample sizes.
* When predicting individual patient trajectories.
* For personalized dosing and treatment selection.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Patient Digital Twin Creation**: Build comprehensive patient models.

2. **Clinical Trial Simulation**: Predict trial outcomes virtually.

3. **Treatment Response Prediction**: Individualized response modeling.

4. **Counterfactual Generation**: "What-if" treatment scenarios.

5. **Longitudinal Prediction**: Forecast disease trajectories.

6. **Trial Design Optimization**: Reduce sample sizes, improve power.
