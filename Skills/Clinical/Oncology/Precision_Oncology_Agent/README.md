# Precision Oncology Agent

**ID:** `biomedical.clinical.oncology.precision_agent`
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** High Priority
**Category:** Clinical / Oncology

---

## Overview

The **Precision Oncology Agent** leverages multimodal LLMs (like GPT-4V or fine-tuned LLaVA) to integrate genomic profiling (NGS), pathology images, and clinical history to recommend personalized cancer therapies.

## Key Capabilities

- **Variant Interpretation:** matches NGS mutations (e.g., *BRAF* V600E) to targeted therapies using OncoKB / CIViC.
- **Trial Matching:** Screens patients against eligibility criteria for active oncology trials.
- **Multimodal Synthesis:** Correlates histology patterns (e.g., tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) with genomic immune markers (TMB, MSI).

## Performance
- 87.2% decision-making accuracy in simulated tumor boards (Nature Cancer 2025).
