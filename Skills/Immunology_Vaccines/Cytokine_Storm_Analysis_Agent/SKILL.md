# Cytokine Storm Analysis Agent

The **Cytokine Storm Analysis Agent** provides comprehensive AI-driven analysis of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and hyperinflammatory states. It integrates cytokine profiling, clinical parameters, and immunological markers for early prediction, severity grading, and treatment guidance in CAR-T therapy, sepsis, and viral infections.

## When to Use This Skill

* When monitoring CAR-T patients for cytokine release syndrome risk.
* To predict CRS severity and timing post-immunotherapy.
* For analyzing cytokine panels in sepsis and viral infections (COVID-19).
* When guiding tocilizumab/siltuximab anti-IL-6 therapy decisions.
* To distinguish CRS from ICANS, HLH, and other inflammatory syndromes.

## Core Capabilities

1. **CRS Risk Prediction**: ML models predict CRS development and severity from baseline factors (tumor burden, disease type, CAR-T product).

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track cytokine dynamics (IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-10, ferritin) with early warning alerts.

3. **Severity Grading**: Automated ASTCT CRS grading using clinical parameters and biomarkers.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**: Distinguish CRS from HLH/MAS, ICANS, infection, and tumor lysis syndrome.

5. **Treatment Guidance**: AI-driven recommendations for tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and supportive care.

6. **Outcome Prediction**: Model response to anti-cytokine therapy and overall outcomes.

## Cytokine Panel Analysis

| Cytokine | Role in CRS | Kinetics | Therapeutic Target |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| IL-6 | Central mediator | Early peak | Tocilizumab, Siltuximab |
| IFN-γ | T-cell activation | Early | Emapalumab |
| IL-1β | Inflammasome | Early | Anakinra |
| IL-10 | Regulatory | Variable | - |
| TNF-α | Pro-inflammatory | Early | Infliximab (caution) |
| IL-2 | T-cell expansion | Early | - |
| GM-CSF | Myeloid activation | Sustained | Lenzilumab |

## ASTCT CRS Grading (Automated)

| Grade | Fever | Hypotension | Hypoxia |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | ≥38°C | None | None |
| 2 | ≥38°C | Responsive to fluids | Low-flow O2 |
| 3 | ≥38°C | One vasopressor | High-flow O2 |
| 4 | ≥38°C | Multiple vasopressors | Ventilation |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Cytokine levels, vital signs, laboratory values, treatment history.

2. **Risk Assessment**: Baseline CRS risk stratification pre-therapy.

3. **Monitoring**: Real-time cytokine tracking with trend analysis.

4. **Grading**: Automated CRS grade assignment per ASTCT criteria.

5. **Differential**: Rule out mimics (infection, HLH, ICANS).

6. **Treatment**: Generate management recommendations.

7. **Output**: CRS risk score, grade, differential diagnosis, treatment plan.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Monitor this CAR-T patient's cytokine levels and predict CRS severity."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Immunology_Vaccines/Cytokine_Storm_Analysis_Agent/crs_analyzer.py \
    --patient_data demographics.json \
    --cytokines cytokine_panel.csv \
    --vitals vital_signs.csv \
    --labs laboratory_values.csv \
    --cart_product tisagenlecleucel \
    --day_post_infusion 5 \
    --model crs_predictor_v3 \
    --output crs_report.json
```

## AI/ML Models

**CRS Risk Prediction**:
- Features: tumor burden (LDH), lymphodepletion intensity, CAR-T dose, disease type
- Model: Gradient boosting with SHAP interpretability
- Performance: AUC 0.82-0.88 for severe CRS

**Severity Trajectory**:
- Time-series modeling of cytokine dynamics
- LSTM networks for temporal patterns
- Early warning 24-48 hours before clinical deterioration

**Treatment Response**:
- Tocilizumab response prediction
- Corticosteroid escalation timing
- ICU admission risk
