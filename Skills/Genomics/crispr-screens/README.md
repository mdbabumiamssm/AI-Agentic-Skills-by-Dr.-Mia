## Overview

Analysis of pooled CRISPR knockout and activation screens for gene essentiality and functional genomics.

**Tool type:** cli | **Primary tools:** MAGeCK, JACKS, CRISPResso2, BAGEL2

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| mageck-analysis | MAGeCK workflow for CRISPR screen analysis |
| jacks-analysis | JACKS for joint sgRNA efficacy and gene essentiality modeling |
| crispresso-editing | CRISPResso2 for CRISPR editing analysis |
| base-editing-analysis | Analyze base editing and prime editing outcomes |
| screen-qc | Quality control for pooled CRISPR screens |
| hit-calling | Statistical methods for identifying screen hits |
| library-design | sgRNA selection and library composition |
| batch-correction | Batch effect correction for multi-batch screens |

## Example Prompts

- "Analyze my CRISPR knockout screen with MAGeCK"
- "Compare treatment vs control screen results"
- "Assess editing efficiency with CRISPResso2"
- "Analyze my base editing experiment for C-to-T conversion"
