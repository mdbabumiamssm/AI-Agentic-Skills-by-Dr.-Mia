## Overview

Analysis of long-read sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio. Covers alignment with minimap2, polishing, variant calling with medaka and Clair3, and structural variant detection with Sniffles.

**Tool type:** cli | **Primary tools:** Dorado, minimap2, Clair3, modkit, IsoSeq3

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| basecalling | Convert raw signal to sequences with Dorado (Guppy is deprecated) |
| long-read-alignment | Align long reads with minimap2 |
| medaka-polishing | Polish assemblies and call variants with medaka |
| clair3-variants | Deep learning variant calling with Clair3 |
| structural-variants | Detect SVs from long reads |
| long-read-qc | Quality control for long reads |
| isoseq-analysis | PacBio Iso-Seq isoform discovery with IsoSeq3, SQANTI3 QC, differential isoforms |
| nanopore-methylation | Call 5mC methylation directly from ONT reads with modkit |
