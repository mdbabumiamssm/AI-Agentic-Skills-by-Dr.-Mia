# STAgent (Spatial Transcriptomics Agent)

**ID:** `biomedical.genomics.st_agent`
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Candidate
**Category:** Genomics / Spatial Transcriptomics

---

## Overview

**STAgent** is a multimodal LLM-based autonomous agent designed for spatial transcriptomics (ST) data analysis. Unlike standard single-cell analysis, ST requires understanding both gene expression and histological (visual) context. STAgent integrates visual reasoning (H&E images) with code generation to perform tasks like identifying spatially variable genes (SVGs) and cell-cell communication analysis.

## Key Capabilities

- **Visual Reasoning:** Analyzes H&E images to identify tissue regions (tumor vs. stroma).
- **Tool Use:** Automates `Scanpy`, `Squidpy`, and `Giotto` workflows.
- **Reporting:** Generates publication-style reports with embedded plots.
