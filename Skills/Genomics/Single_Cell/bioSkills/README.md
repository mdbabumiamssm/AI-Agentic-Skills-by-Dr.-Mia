## Overview

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis using Seurat (R) and Scanpy (Python). Covers the complete workflow from loading data through quality control, normalization, clustering, marker gene identification, and cell type annotation.

**Tool type:** mixed | **Primary tools:** Seurat, Scanpy, Pertpy, Cassiopeia, MeboCost

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| data-io | Load 10X data, create Seurat/AnnData objects, read/write h5ad/RDS |
| preprocessing | QC metrics, filtering, normalization, HVGs, scaling |
| doublet-detection | Detect and remove doublets with Scrublet, DoubletFinder, scDblFinder |
| batch-integration | Multi-sample integration with Harmony, scVI, Seurat CCA/RPCA |
| clustering | PCA, neighbors, Leiden/Louvain clustering, UMAP/tSNE |
| markers-annotation | Differential expression, marker genes, cell type annotation |
| cell-annotation | Automated cell type annotation with CellTypist, SingleR, Azimuth |
| trajectory-inference | Developmental trajectories with Monocle3, Slingshot, scVelo |
| cell-communication | Cell-cell communication with CellChat, NicheNet, LIANA |
| multimodal-integration | CITE-seq, Multiome, WNN clustering for multi-modal data |
| scatac-analysis | Single-cell ATAC-seq with Signac and ArchR |
| perturb-seq | Analyze Perturb-seq/CROP-seq with Pertpy, Mixscape; guide assignment, DE, pathway enrichment |
| lineage-tracing | Reconstruct lineages from CRISPR barcodes with Cassiopeia, CoSpar; tree inference, fate mapping |
| metabolite-communication | Metabolite-mediated cell-cell communication with MeboCost |
