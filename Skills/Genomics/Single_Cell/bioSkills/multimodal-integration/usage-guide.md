# Multimodal Integration - Usage Guide

## Overview

Multi-modal single-cell technologies measure multiple biological layers per cell (RNA + protein, RNA + chromatin accessibility), enabling deeper insights into cell states through joint analysis.

## Prerequisites

```r
# R/Seurat
install.packages('Seurat')
BiocManager::install('Signac')  # For ATAC
```

```bash
# Python
pip install muon scanpy anndata
```

## Quick Start

Tell your AI agent what you want to do:
- "Integrate my CITE-seq RNA and protein data"
- "Run WNN clustering on my multiome data"
- "Combine scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq from the same cells"

## Example Prompts

### CITE-seq (RNA + Protein)
> "Load my CITE-seq data with RNA and ADT counts"
> "Normalize the protein data using CLR"
> "Run weighted nearest neighbors clustering"

### Multiome (RNA + ATAC)
> "Process my 10X Multiome data"
> "Find peaks associated with each cell type"
> "Create a joint UMAP from RNA and ATAC"

### Integration
> "Compare modality weights across cell types"
> "Show which modality drives clustering in each population"
> "Transfer labels from RNA to ATAC modality"

## What the Agent Will Do

1. Load and validate both modalities
2. Normalize each modality appropriately (log for RNA, CLR for protein, TF-IDF for ATAC)
3. Run dimension reduction on each modality
4. Compute weighted nearest neighbors graph
5. Cluster cells using joint information
6. Generate UMAP visualization
7. Assess contribution of each modality

## Technologies

| Technology | Measures | Cells/Run |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| CITE-seq | RNA + ~200 proteins | 10,000+ |
| 10X Multiome | RNA + chromatin accessibility | 10,000+ |
| SHARE-seq | RNA + ATAC | ~10,000 |
| Visium | RNA + spatial location | ~5,000 spots |

## Key Concepts

### Weighted Nearest Neighbors (WNN)
- Combines information from multiple modalities
- Weights each modality per cell based on informativeness
- Creates unified cell-cell graph for clustering

### CLR Normalization (for proteins)
- Centered Log-Ratio transformation
- Standard for ADT/protein data
- Handles compositional nature of antibody capture

## Tips

- **QC each modality separately** before integration
- **Normalize appropriately** - different methods for RNA vs protein vs ATAC
- **Check modality weights** - ensure both contribute meaningfully
- **Validate with known biology** - protein markers should match cell types
- **Use WNN graph** for clustering, not individual modality graphs
