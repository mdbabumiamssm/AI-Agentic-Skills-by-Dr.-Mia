(v1.4.2)=
### 1.4.2 {small}`2019-05-06`

#### New functionality

- {func}`~scanpy.pp.combat` supports additional covariates which may include adjustment variables or biological condition {pr}`618` {smaller}`G Eraslan`
- {func}`~scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes` has a `batch_key` option which performs HVG selection in each batch separately to avoid selecting genes that vary strongly across batches {pr}`622` {smaller}`G Eraslan`

#### Bug fixes

- {func}`~scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups` t-test implementation doesn't return NaN when variance is 0, also changed to scipy's implementation {pr}`621` {smaller}`I Virshup`
- {func}`~scanpy.tl.umap` with `init_pos='paga'` detects correct `dtype` {smaller}`A Wolf`
- {func}`~scanpy.tl.louvain` and {func}`~scanpy.tl.leiden` auto-generate `key_added=louvain_R` upon passing `restrict_to`, which was temporarily changed in `1.4.1` {smaller}`A Wolf`

#### Code design

- {func}`~scanpy.pp.neighbors` and {func}`~scanpy.tl.umap` got rid of UMAP legacy code and introduced UMAP as a dependency {pr}`576` {smaller}`S Rybakov`
