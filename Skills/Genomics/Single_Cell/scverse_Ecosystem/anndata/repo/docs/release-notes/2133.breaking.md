    this isn’t actually a breaking change, but it needs to be far up in the changelog.
    maybe we should move the “attention” directive up when compiling release notes?

Switch {attr}`anndata.settings.allow_write_nullable_strings` to new default `None`,
which means the writing of pandas string arrays will be controlled by `pandas.options.future.infer_string`
(see the {doc}`pandas:user_guide/migration-3-strings`).
Setting `allow_write_nullable_strings=False` explicitly now means to try writing the array in the non-nullable string array format,
which was the only supported format up to anndata 0.11.

.. attention::

   In anndata 0.14, {attr}`anndata.settings.allow_write_nullable_strings` will default to `True`,
   so take care to test your code with the upcoming default value.
