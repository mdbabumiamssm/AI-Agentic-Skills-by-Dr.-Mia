(v0.10.6)=
### 0.10.6 {small}`2024-03-11`

#### Bug fixes

* Defer import of zarr in test helpers, as scanpy CI job relies on them {pr}`1343` {user}`ilan-gold`
* Writing a dataframe with non-unique column names now throws an error, instead of silently overwriting {pr}`1335` {user}`ivirshup`
* Bring optimization from {pr}`1233` to indexing on the whole `AnnData` object, not just the sparse dataset itself {pr}`1365` {user}`ilan-gold`
* Fix mean slice length checking to use improved performance when indexing backed sparse matrices with boolean masks along their major axis {pr}`1366` {user}`ilan-gold`
* Fixed overflow occurring when writing dask arrays with sparse chunks by always writing dask arrays with 64 bit indptr and indices, and adding an overflow check to `.append` method of sparse on disk structures {pr}`1348` {user}`ivirshup`
* Modified `ValueError` message for invalid `.X` during construction to show more helpful list instead of ambiguous `__name__` {pr}`1395` {user}`eroell`
* Pin `array-api-compat!=1.5` to avoid incorrect implementation of `asarray` {pr}`1411` {user}`ivirshup`

#### Documentation

* Type hints and docstrings for `.to_df` method are updated and fixed {pr}`1402` {user}`WeilerP`

#### Development

* `anndata`'s CI now tests against minimum versions of it's dependencies. As a result, several dependencies had their minimum required version bumped. See diff for details {pr}`1314` {user}`ivirshup`
* `anndata` now tests against Python 3.12 {pr}`1373` {user}`ivirshup`
