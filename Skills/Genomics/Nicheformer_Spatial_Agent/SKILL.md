# Nicheformer Spatial Agent

The **Nicheformer Spatial Agent** leverages the Nicheformer foundation model, trained on over 53 million spatially resolved cells, to model cellular architecture and tissue microenvironments with unprecedented accuracy. It enables spatial context-aware cell type annotation, niche discovery, and tissue organization analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

* When analyzing spatial transcriptomics requiring deep cellular context understanding.
* For identifying tissue niches and cellular neighborhoods.
* To predict cell-cell interactions based on spatial proximity.
* When transferring annotations from atlases to new spatial data.
* For studying tissue architecture and organization patterns.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Spatial Context Embeddings**: Generate embeddings that capture both gene expression and spatial context.

2. **Niche Discovery**: Identify recurrent cellular neighborhoods across tissues.

3. **Zero-Shot Cell Type Annotation**: Transfer cell type labels without retraining.

4. **Spatial Perturbation Prediction**: Predict effects of removing cell types from niches.

5. **Cross-Tissue Transfer**: Apply models trained on one tissue to another.

6. **Tissue Architecture Analysis**: Quantify spatial organization patterns.

| Expression Encoder | Gene expression transformer | ~100M |
| Spatial Encoder | Neighborhood graph attention | ~50M |
| Fusion Layer | Cross-attention expression + spatial | ~30M |
| Pretraining Data | 53M+ spatially resolved cells | Multi-tissue |

3. **Embedding Generation**: Compute Nicheformer embeddings per cell/spot.

4. **Niche Clustering**: Identify spatial domains and niches.

5. **Annotation Transfer**: Map cell types from reference atlases.

6. **Interaction Analysis**: Predict cell-cell communication in niches.

7. **Output**: Annotated spatial data, niche assignments, interaction networks.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Use Nicheformer to identify cellular niches in this tumor spatial transcriptomics dataset."
