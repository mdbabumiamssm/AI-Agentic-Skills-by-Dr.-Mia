# Joint Calling - Usage Guide

## Overview

Multi-sample joint genotyping combines information across samples for improved variant detection, consistent site calling, and eligibility for machine learning-based filtering (VQSR).

## Prerequisites

```bash
conda install -c bioconda gatk4
```

## Quick Start

Tell your AI agent what you want to do:
- "Set up joint calling for my cohort of 50 samples"
- "Combine GVCFs and run GenotypeGVCFs"
- "Scale joint calling for 1000+ samples by chromosome"
- "Choose between CombineGVCFs and GenomicsDBImport"

## Example Prompts

### Small Cohort
> "Combine these 10 sample GVCFs and run joint genotyping"

> "Run CombineGVCFs followed by GenotypeGVCFs for my family trio"

### Large Cohort
> "Set up GenomicsDBImport for 500 samples, processing by chromosome"

> "Create a sample map file and import into GenomicsDB"

### GVCF Generation
> "Generate GVCFs from all BAM files for joint calling"

> "Run HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode for each sample in the cohort"

### Post-Processing
> "Apply VQSR to my joint-called cohort VCF"

> "Joint call my samples and then apply hard filters"

## What the Agent Will Do

1. Generate per-sample GVCFs using HaplotypeCaller with -ERC GVCF
2. Select appropriate combining method (CombineGVCFs vs GenomicsDBImport)
3. Combine GVCFs across samples
4. Run GenotypeGVCFs to produce the cohort VCF
5. Apply VQSR or hard filtering based on cohort size
6. Validate output with variant statistics

## Tips

- Use GenomicsDBImport for cohorts >50 samples (more scalable)
- CombineGVCFs is simpler for small cohorts (<50 samples)
- Process large cohorts by chromosome to parallelize and manage memory
- Always generate GVCFs (not VCFs) when planning joint calling
- VQSR requires enough variants to train; fall back to hard filters if it fails

## Why Joint Calling?

- **Better sensitivity**: Leverage information across samples
- **Consistent sites**: Same positions called in all samples
- **VQSR eligible**: Machine learning filtering requires cohorts
- **Population frequencies**: Calculate allele frequencies across cohort

## Workflow Overview

```
Sample BAMs -> HaplotypeCaller (GVCF mode) -> CombineGVCFs -> GenotypeGVCFs -> Cohort VCF
```

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Generate per-sample GVCFs

```bash
gatk HaplotypeCaller \
    -R reference.fa \
    -I sample1.bam \
    -O sample1.g.vcf.gz \
    -ERC GVCF
```

### 2. Combine GVCFs

#### Option A: CombineGVCFs (small cohorts)

```bash
gatk CombineGVCFs \
    -R reference.fa \
    -V sample1.g.vcf.gz \
    -V sample2.g.vcf.gz \
    -V sample3.g.vcf.gz \
    -O combined.g.vcf.gz
```

#### Option B: GenomicsDBImport (large cohorts)

```bash
gatk GenomicsDBImport \
    -V sample1.g.vcf.gz \
    -V sample2.g.vcf.gz \
    -V sample3.g.vcf.gz \
    --genomicsdb-workspace-path genomicsdb \
    -L intervals.bed
```

### 3. Joint Genotyping

```bash
# From CombineGVCFs
gatk GenotypeGVCFs \
    -R reference.fa \
    -V combined.g.vcf.gz \
    -O cohort.vcf.gz

# From GenomicsDB
gatk GenotypeGVCFs \
    -R reference.fa \
    -V gendb://genomicsdb \
    -O cohort.vcf.gz
```

## Scaling Tips

| Cohort Size | Method | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| < 50 | CombineGVCFs | Simple, single command |
| 50-1000 | GenomicsDBImport | Scalable, interval-based |
| > 1000 | GenomicsDBImport + batches | Process in batches |

### Large Cohort Strategy

```bash
# Import by chromosome
for chr in {1..22} X Y; do
    gatk GenomicsDBImport \
        --sample-name-map samples.map \
        --genomicsdb-workspace-path genomicsdb_chr${chr} \
        -L chr${chr}
done

# Genotype by chromosome, then merge
```

## Post-Processing

```bash
# Apply VQSR (requires large cohorts)
gatk VariantRecalibrator ...
gatk ApplyVQSR ...

# Or hard filter for small cohorts
gatk VariantFiltration \
    -V cohort.vcf.gz \
    --filter-expression "QD < 2.0" --filter-name "LowQD" \
    -O filtered.vcf.gz
```
