# Organoid Drug Response Agent

The **Organoid Drug Response Agent** provides AI-driven analysis of patient-derived organoid (PDO) drug screening data for personalized treatment selection. It correlates organoid drug responses with patient outcomes and molecular profiles to guide precision oncology decisions.

## When to Use This Skill

* When interpreting organoid drug screening results for treatment selection.
* To correlate PDO drug sensitivity with molecular features.
* For identifying combination therapies using organoid co-culture systems.
* When predicting patient response from organoid-derived data.
* To discover biomarkers from large-scale organoid screens.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Drug Response Analysis**: Process organoid viability data to calculate IC50, AUC, and response metrics.

2. **Patient-Organoid Concordance**: Assess molecular fidelity between PDO and donor tumor.

3. **Biomarker Discovery**: Identify molecular features predicting drug sensitivity.

4. **Combination Screening**: Analyze drug synergy from combination matrices.

5. **Clinical Translation**: Project organoid findings to patient treatment recommendations.

6. **Microenvironment Modeling**: Analyze immune co-culture and CAF interactions.

## Organoid Advantages

| Feature | Organoids | Cell Lines | PDX |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----|
| Patient fidelity | High | Low | High |
| Establishment rate | 60-90% | Variable | 30-50% |
| Turnaround | 4-8 weeks | Fast | 3-6 months |
| Throughput | Medium-high | Very high | Low |
| Microenvironment | Partial | None | Mouse |
| Cost | Medium | Low | High |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Organoid drug screening data, organoid molecular profiles, patient tumor data.

2. **QC**: Assess organoid viability and growth metrics.

3. **Response Calculation**: Compute drug sensitivity metrics.

4. **Concordance**: Compare organoid to donor tumor molecular profiles.

5. **Biomarker Analysis**: Correlate sensitivity with molecular features.

6. **Translation**: Generate patient treatment recommendations.

7. **Output**: Drug rankings, biomarkers, recommended treatments.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze organoid drug screening results for this colorectal cancer patient and recommend treatments."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Oncology/Organoid_Drug_Response_Agent/organoid_analyzer.py \
    --screening_data drug_screen_384well.csv \
    --organoid_rnaseq organoid_expression.tsv \
