# Bone Marrow AI Agent

The **Bone Marrow AI Agent** provides comprehensive AI-driven analysis of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens. It performs automated cell identification, differential counting, morphological assessment, and pattern recognition for hematologic disease diagnosis.

## When to Use This Skill

* When performing automated bone marrow differential counts from aspirate smears.
* To identify morphological abnormalities (dysplasia, blasts, abnormal cells).
* For pattern recognition in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), leukemias, and other disorders.
* When assessing cellularity, fibrosis, and infiltration in trephine biopsies.
* To standardize morphological assessment across institutions.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Cell Classification**: Deep learning identification and classification of 15+ bone marrow cell types with >95% accuracy.

2. **Automated Differential**: Rapid 500-cell differential counts from digital aspirate images.

3. **Dysplasia Detection**: AI recognition of dyserythropoiesis, dysgranulopoiesis, and dysmegakaryopoiesis.

4. **Blast Quantification**: Accurate blast percentage enumeration for AML/MDS classification.

5. **Biopsy Analysis**: Cellularity estimation, fibrosis grading, and infiltration pattern recognition.

6. **Quality Assessment**: Automated specimen adequacy and hemodilution detection.

## Cell Types Classified

| Lineage | Cell Types | Key Features |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Erythroid | Pronormoblast, basophilic, polychromatic, orthochromatic | Size, chromatin, cytoplasm color |
| Myeloid | Myeloblast, promyelocyte, myelocyte, metamyelocyte, band, seg | Granules, nuclear shape |
| Monocytic | Monoblast, promonocyte, monocyte | Nuclear folding, cytoplasm |
| Lymphoid | Lymphocyte, plasma cell | Size, chromatin density |
| Megakaryocytic | Megakaryocytes (all stages) | Size, nuclear lobation |
| Other | Mast cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts | Distinctive morphology |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Bone marrow aspirate images (Wright-Giemsa stained) or biopsy sections (H&E).

2. **Preprocessing**: Color normalization, focus stacking, region of interest selection.

3. **Cell Detection**: Instance segmentation to identify individual cells.

4. **Classification**: CNN/CoAtNet model assigns cell type labels.

5. **Differential**: Aggregate counts and calculate percentages.

6. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify disease-associated morphological patterns.

7. **Output**: Differential count, morphology report, diagnostic suggestions.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Analyze this bone marrow aspirate smear and provide a differential count with morphological assessment."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 Skills/Hematology/Bone_Marrow_AI_Agent/bm_analyzer.py \
    --image aspirate_smear.tiff \
    --stain wright_giemsa \
    --target_cells 500 \
    --assess_dysplasia true \
    --model coatnet_bm_v2 \
    --output bm_report.json
```
