# Coagulation and Thrombosis Agent

The **Coagulation and Thrombosis Agent** provides AI-driven analysis of hemostatic disorders, thrombosis risk assessment, and anticoagulation management. It integrates coagulation cascade modeling, platelet function analysis, and machine learning for personalized thrombosis prevention.

## When to Use This Skill

* When assessing venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in hospitalized patients.
* For anticoagulation dose optimization (warfarin, DOACs).
* To analyze coagulation panel results and identify bleeding/clotting disorders.
* For platelet morphology and function assessment.
* When managing thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).

## Core Capabilities

1. **VTE Risk Prediction**: Machine learning models predict deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) risk using clinical and laboratory features.

2. **Anticoagulation Optimization**: AI-guided dosing for warfarin (incorporating pharmacogenomics) and monitoring for DOACs.

3. **Coagulation Cascade Analysis**: Interprets PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and specialized assays to diagnose coagulopathies.

4. **Platelet Analysis**: CNN-based morphology analysis predicting bleeding and thrombosis risk from peripheral smear images.

5. **DIC Scoring**: Automated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring and monitoring.

6. **MPN Thrombosis Risk**: Specialized models for thrombosis prediction in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia.

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Coagulation lab results, patient demographics, clinical risk factors, platelet images (optional).

2. **Risk Assessment**: Apply ML models for VTE, bleeding, or DIC risk scores.

3. **Dosing Optimization**: Generate anticoagulation recommendations.

4. **Monitoring**: Track INR/anti-Xa trends and alert on deviations.

5. **Diagnosis**: Pattern recognition for coagulation disorders.

6. **Output**: Risk scores, dosing recommendations, diagnostic suggestions, monitoring alerts.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Calculate VTE risk for this hospitalized patient and optimize LMWH prophylaxis."

**Agent Action**:

| aPTT | 25-35s | Heparin, VIII/IX/XI def, lupus AC | - |
| Fibrinogen | 200-400 mg/dL | Acute phase, inflammation | DIC, liver disease |
| D-dimer | <500 ng/mL | VTE, DIC, inflammation | - |
| Platelet | 150-400K | Reactive, MPN | ITP, marrow failure |
