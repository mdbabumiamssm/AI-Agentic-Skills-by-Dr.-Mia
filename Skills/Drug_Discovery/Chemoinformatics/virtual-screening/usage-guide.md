# Virtual Screening - Usage Guide

## Overview
Screen compound libraries against protein targets using molecular docking with AutoDock Vina. Predict binding poses and affinities for hit identification.

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install vina
pip install rdkit openbabel-wheel
```

## Quick Start
Tell your AI agent what you want to do:
- "Dock my compound library against this protein"
- "Set up a virtual screen against the binding site"
- "Rank compounds by predicted binding affinity"
- "Prepare my protein for docking"

## Example Prompts

### Receptor Preparation
> "Prepare my protein PDB for docking by removing waters and adding hydrogens."

> "Convert my protein to PDBQT format for Vina."

### Docking
> "Dock this ligand to my protein and show the best poses."

> "Screen my library of 1000 compounds against the active site."

### Analysis
> "Rank my docked compounds by binding affinity."

> "Extract the top 10 hits with affinities better than -8 kcal/mol."

## What the Agent Will Do
1. Prepare receptor (remove waters, add H, convert to PDBQT)
2. Prepare ligands (generate 3D, minimize, convert to PDBQT)
3. Define binding site from ligand or coordinates
4. Run Vina docking for each compound
5. Collect and rank results by affinity

## Tips
- AutoDock Vina 1.2.x is the baseline; Vina-GPU 2.1 is 65x faster
- Box size should generally be < 30x30x30 Angstroms
- Exhaustiveness: 8 (quick), 32 (production), 64 (thorough)
- Center binding box on co-crystallized ligand if available
- Remove waters and add hydrogens at pH 7.4 for receptor prep
- Note: Vina 1.1.2 vs 1.2 may give different poses
