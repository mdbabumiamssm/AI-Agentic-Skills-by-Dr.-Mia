# DeepResearch Swarm

A coordinated swarm of agents designed to perform deep, parallelized research into biomedical literature, aggregating findings into comprehensive reports.

## When to Use This Skill

*   When you need an exhaustive review of a specific medical topic.
*   When connecting disparate pieces of evidence across thousands of papers.
*   When generating hypotheses based on recent literature.

## Core Capabilities

1.  **Parallel Search**: Querying multiple databases simultaneously.
2.  **Evidence Synthesis**: Combining facts into a coherent narrative.
3.  **Citation Verification**: Ensuring all claims are backed by sources.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Research the latest advancements in mRNA cancer vaccines."

**Agent Action**:
```bash
python3 src/research/agents/agent_coordinator.py --topic "mRNA cancer vaccines" --depth "deep"
```
