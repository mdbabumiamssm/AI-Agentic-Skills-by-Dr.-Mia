## Overview

Phylogenetic tree analysis using Biopython's Bio.Phylo module. Covers reading/writing tree files, manipulating tree structure (rooting, pruning, ladderizing), visualizing trees with matplotlib, and building trees from sequence alignments.

**Tool type:** python, cli | **Primary tools:** Bio.Phylo, IQ-TREE2, RAxML-ng

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| tree-io | Read, write, convert tree files (Newick, Nexus, PhyloXML, NeXML) |
| tree-visualization | Draw trees with matplotlib, customize labels and colors, export figures |
| tree-manipulation | Root, prune, ladderize, collapse, and modify tree structure |
| distance-calculations | Compute distance matrices, build NJ/UPGMA/parsimony trees, bootstrap consensus |
| modern-tree-inference | Build ML trees with IQ-TREE2/RAxML-ng, model selection, ultrafast bootstrap |

## Example Prompts

- "Read this Newick tree file and show the taxa"
- "Convert my Nexus tree to Newick format"
- "Parse all trees from this MrBayes output"
- "Draw this tree and save as PDF"
- "Show bootstrap values on the tree"
- "Create a tree figure with branch lengths labeled"
- "Root this tree using Mouse as outgroup"
- "Remove all bacterial sequences from the tree"
- "Ladderize the tree for cleaner visualization"
- "Collapse clades with bootstrap < 70"
- "Build a neighbor joining tree from this alignment"
- "Create a bootstrap consensus with 1000 replicates"
- "Calculate pairwise distances between all taxa"
- "Build UPGMA tree from distance matrix"
- "Run IQ-TREE2 with ultrafast bootstrap on my alignment"
- "Find the best substitution model and build an ML tree"
- "Analyze my multi-gene dataset with partitioned models"

## Requirements

```bash
pip install biopython matplotlib numpy

# For modern ML inference
conda install -c bioconda iqtree raxml-ng
```
