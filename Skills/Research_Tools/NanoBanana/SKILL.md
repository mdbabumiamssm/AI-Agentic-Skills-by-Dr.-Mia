# Nano Banana

Nano Banana is a cutting-edge AI tool serving as a "reasoning image engine." It is particularly powerful for life sciences, enabling the creation of accurate anatomical diagrams, cellular workflow infographics, and realistic synthetic microscopy or radiological images.

## When to Use This Skill
- You need to generate complex biomedical infographics (e.g., "Explain the mechanism of action for drug X").
- You require synthetic data augmentation for medical imaging datasets.
- You want to edit existing scientific images using natural language commands.
- You need visual aids for educational or presentation purposes in healthcare.

## Core Capabilities
1.  **Reasoning Image Generation**: Creates images based on deep semantic understanding of the prompt, ensuring factual accuracy in scientific contexts.
2.  **Natural Language Editing**: Allows users to modify specific parts of an image (e.g., "Change the cell type to a neuron") via chat.
3.  **Biomedical Specialization**: Fine-tuned or capable of handling domain-specific requests like anatomical structures and molecular pathways.
4.  **Infographic Creation**: Synthesizes structured visual information for clear communication.

## Workflow
1.  **Prompting**: Describe the desired image or infographic in detail, including scientific constraints.
2.  **Generation**: The engine produces a set of candidate images.
3.  **Editing**: Use natural language to refine the selected image (e.g., "Label the mitochondria").
4.  **Export**: Download the final high-resolution asset.
