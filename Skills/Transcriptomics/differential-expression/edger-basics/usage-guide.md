# edgeR Basics - Usage Guide

## Overview

This skill covers differential expression analysis using edgeR, a powerful Bioconductor package that uses empirical Bayes methods to moderate gene-wise dispersion estimates. The quasi-likelihood F-test framework provides robust results even with small sample sizes.

## Prerequisites

```r
if (!require('BiocManager', quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install('edgeR')
```

## Quick Start

Tell your AI agent what you want to do:
- "Run edgeR analysis on my count matrix with treated vs control comparison"
- "Perform differential expression with edgeR controlling for batch"
- "Get top differentially expressed genes with FDR < 0.05"

## Example Prompts

### Basic Analysis
> "Create a DGEList from my count matrix"

> "Run the standard edgeR quasi-likelihood workflow"

> "Normalize my RNA-seq data with TMM"

### Design and Contrasts
> "Set up edgeR with multiple comparisons"

> "Create contrasts to compare all treatments against control"

> "Test for interaction effects between genotype and treatment"

### Results
> "Get genes with FDR < 0.05 and |logFC| > 1"

> "Export edgeR results to CSV"

> "Compare edgeR and DESeq2 results"

## What the Agent Will Do

1. Create DGEList object from counts
2. Filter low-expression genes with filterByExpr()
3. Normalize using TMM (calcNormFactors)
4. Set up appropriate design matrix
5. Estimate dispersions (estimateDisp)
6. Fit quasi-likelihood model (glmQLFit)
7. Perform statistical testing (glmQLFTest)
8. Extract and filter results

## Input Requirements

| Input | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Count matrix | Integer matrix | Genes (rows) x Samples (columns) |
| Group factor | Factor | Sample group assignments |
| Design matrix | Matrix | From model.matrix() |

## Tips

- Use `filterByExpr()` for automatic low-count filtering
- The quasi-likelihood framework (glmQLFit) is recommended over exact test
- For complex designs, use design matrices without intercept (~ 0 + group)
- `glmTreat()` tests for log fold changes above a threshold
- edgeR v4+ makes `estimateDisp()` optional before `glmQLFit()`
