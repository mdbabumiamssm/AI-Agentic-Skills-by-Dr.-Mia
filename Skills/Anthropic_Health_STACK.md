# Anthropic Health & Life Sciences Stack (2026)

**Focus:** Operationalizing Anthropic's "Claude for Healthcare" vision inside the Universal AI Agentic Skills Platform. This stack emphasizes asynchronous coworker agents, MCP-native tooling, and regulatory-grade audit trails.

Based on: [Anthropic Healthcare & Life Sciences Announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/healthcare-life-sciences)

## New Coworker Skills (January 2026)

| Coworker | File | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FHIR Development** | `Anthropic_Health_Stack/fhir_development_coworker.py` | Generates FHIR R4 compliant resources (Patient, Observation, Condition, MedicationRequest). Improves healthcare interoperability. |
| **Claims Appeals** | `Anthropic_Health_Stack/claims_appeals_coworker.py` | Processes insurance claims appeals with evidence synthesis from clinical guidelines (ACR, NCCN) and CMS policies. |
| **Care Coordination** | `Anthropic_Health_Stack/care_coordination_coworker.py` | Triages patient portal messages, identifies urgent matters, routes to appropriate care teams. |
| **Research Literature** | `Anthropic_Health_Stack/research_literature_coworker.py` | PubMed integration with MeSH term expansion and evidence-graded synthesis. |
| **Lab Results** | `Anthropic_Health_Stack/lab_results_coworker.py` | Interprets lab results with patient-friendly explanations and clinical pattern recognition. |

## Core Components

| Layer | File(s) | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inbox Router | `Clinical/anthropic_inbox_router.py` | Parses work requests (prior auth, safety, regulatory) and fans them out to specialist coworkers via the Event Bus. |
| Prior Authorization Coworker | `Clinical/Prior_Authorization/anthropic_coworker.py` | Emits `<thinking>`, `<analysis>`, `<decision>` blocks plus structured JSON justifications to mirror Anthropic coworker transcripts. |
| Regulatory Response Coworker | `Pharma/Regulatory_Affairs/anthropic_regulatory_coworker.py` | Drafts and reviews CTD/Module 2 updates with built-in policy citations and routing for human sign-off. |
| Pharmacovigilance Monitor | `Clinical/Safety/pharmacovigilance_monitor.py` | Prioritizes adverse event signals, tags risk levels, and publishes asynchronous status cards. |
| Regulatory Drafter | `Anthropic_Health_Stack/regulatory_drafter.py` | Drafts regulatory submissions with audit trails. |

## Healthcare Connectors

Per Anthropic's announcement, Claude for Healthcare integrates with:

- **CMS Coverage Database** - Local and National Coverage Determinations
- **ICD-10 Classification System** - Diagnosis and procedure codes
- **National Provider Identifier Registry** - Credentialing and claims validation
- **PubMed** - 35+ million biomedical literature sources

## Operating Pattern

1. **Event Intake** – The inbox router listens to `anthropic.health.inbox` topics (e.g., "PA request", "safety signal", "FDA query").
2. **Coworker Loop** – Specialist modules fetch artifacts, run reasoning traces, emit `<thinking>` logs, and deposit deliverables back on the bus.
3. **Audit & Replay** – Every coworker attaches citations, policy versions, and timestamped determinations, enabling full audit replay.
4. **Human in the Loop** – Each worker can request clarification or escalate via `needs-human-review` events, matching Anthropic's "copilot/coordinator" messaging.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# FHIR Resource Generation
python3 Skills/Anthropic_Health_Stack/fhir_development_coworker.py

# Claims Appeals Processing
python3 Skills/Anthropic_Health_Stack/claims_appeals_coworker.py

# Patient Message Triage
python3 Skills/Anthropic_Health_Stack/care_coordination_coworker.py

# Literature Search & Synthesis
python3 Skills/Anthropic_Health_Stack/research_literature_coworker.py

# Lab Results Interpretation
python3 Skills/Anthropic_Health_Stack/lab_results_coworker.py

# Prior Authorization Review
python3 Skills/Clinical/Prior_Authorization/anthropic_coworker.py examples/mri_case.json

# Route Multiple Inbox Items
python3 Skills/Clinical/anthropic_inbox_router.py examples/inbox.json
```

Each module prints the structured payload using Claude's XML-style tags (`<thinking>`, `<analysis>`, `<decision>`) along with JSON representations for CoreKernel integration.

## Integration Notes

* Register MCP tools (`anthropic.prior_auth`, `anthropic.fhir`, `anthropic.claims_appeal`, `anthropic.care_triage`, `anthropic.lab_interpret`) so Claude Desktop clients can subscribe directly.
* Extend the Optimizer with an `anthropic` target that wraps tasks inside the `<thinking>/<analysis>/<decision>` contract.
* Mirror Anthropic's compliance stance by persisting every coworker exchange to the Audit Log and signing responses with the Event Bus digest helper.
* Drive every coworker definition from USDL specs so the Anthropic prompt/tag layout always matches the OpenAI/Gemini variants (see `docs/USDL_OVERVIEW.md`).

## Safety & Compliance

Per Anthropic's acceptable use policy:
> "A qualified professional must review the content or decision prior to dissemination or finalization when Claude is used for healthcare decisions."

All coworkers emit audit trails and support human-in-the-loop escalation for critical decisions.
