# Scientific Manuscript Preparation

## Document Structure for High-Impact Journals

### Title
- Concise (<15 words for Nature, <20 for Blood)
- Include key finding and system/disease
- Avoid jargon and abbreviations

### Abstract (Structured for Blood/Clinical Journals)

```markdown
**Background:** One sentence on knowledge gap.
**Methods:** Key approaches, patient cohort size, techniques.
**Results:** Primary findings with statistics (P values, CIs).
**Conclusions:** Clinical/translational significance.
```

### Introduction (~500-800 words)
1. **Paragraph 1**: Broad context, disease burden, clinical relevance
2. **Paragraph 2**: Current knowledge, key mechanisms
3. **Paragraph 3**: Knowledge gap, unanswered questions
4. **Paragraph 4**: Study aims, hypothesis, approach overview

### Methods (Detailed, Reproducible)

```markdown
**Patient Cohort and Samples**
- IRB approval number, consent process
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Sample processing, storage conditions

**Single-Cell RNA Sequencing**
- Library preparation (10x Genomics Chromium 3' v3.1)
- Sequencing platform, read depth
- Quality metrics (cells/sample, genes/cell, % mitochondrial)

**Computational Analysis**
- Software versions (Scanpy 1.9.x, scvi-tools 0.20.x)
- QC thresholds (min genes, max %MT)
- Integration method (TotalVI, Harmony)
- Clustering parameters (resolution, n_neighbors)
- Differential expression (Wilcoxon, FDR < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1)

**Statistical Analysis**
- Software (R 4.3.x, Python 3.11)
- Tests used with justification
- Multiple testing correction method
- Power analysis if applicable
```

### Results (~2000-3000 words)
- Lead each paragraph with key finding
- Reference figures in order (Figure 1A-C...)
- Report exact P values (P = 0.003, not P < 0.05)
- Include confidence intervals where relevant
- Avoid interpretation; save for Discussion

### Discussion (~1500-2000 words)

```markdown
**Paragraph 1**: Summarize key findings, relate to hypothesis

**Paragraph 2-4**: Compare to existing literature
- "Consistent with [Author et al.], we found..."
- "In contrast to [Study], our analysis revealed..."
- Mechanistic interpretation

**Paragraph 5**: Translational/Clinical implications
- Therapeutic targets
- Biomarkers
- Patient stratification

**Paragraph 6**: Limitations
- Sample size, cohort characteristics
- Technical limitations
- Generalizability

**Paragraph 7**: Future directions and conclusion
```

## Statistical Reporting Standards

### Continuous Variables
- Mean ± SD (normal) or Median [IQR] (non-normal)
- Report normality test used

### Categorical Variables
- N (%) with comparison test

### P Values
- Report exact values (P = 0.023)
- For very small: P < 0.0001
- Always report test used

### Sample Sizes
- "n = X patients" or "n = X cells"
- Report for each comparison group

## Figure Legends Template

```markdown
**Figure 1. Title describes main finding**
(A) Brief description of panel A. Statistical test, P value.
(B) Description including axis labels if not obvious.
(C-D) Can combine similar panels.
Scale bars: X μm. Error bars: mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
n = X biological replicates from Y independent experiments.
```

## Reference Formatting

### Blood Journal (Vancouver)
```
1. Smith JA, Jones BC. Title of article. Blood. 2024;143(5):567-578.
```

### Nature (Author-Year)
```
Smith, J.A. & Jones, B.C. Title of article. Nature 620, 567–578 (2024).
```

## Journal-Specific Requirements

### Blood (ASH)
- Word limit: 4000 (full article)
- Figures: 7 max
- References: 60 max
- Structured abstract: 250 words

### Nature
- Word limit: ~3000 (Article)
- Main text figures: 6-8
- Methods: no limit, separate section
- Extended Data for supplementary figures

### Cell
- Word limit: 7000 (Article)
- STAR Methods format
- Graphical abstract required

## HIPAA Compliance Reminders

- No patient identifiers in any form
- Use Specimen IDs, not patient names/MRNs
- Aggregate data for small groups (n < 5)
- IRB approval statement required
- Data availability statement (GEO accession for sequencing)

## Writing Style

- Active voice preferred
- Past tense for results ("We found...")
- Present tense for established facts
- Avoid "interesting," "significant" (unless statistical)
- Be specific: "83.9-fold increase" not "marked increase"
